##Credits and Inspirations
Big shout out to [MadeByOliver](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver) for the flat icons used. You can visit his Dribble profile [here](https://dribbble.com/olivers).<br>
Also, UI was inspired by [Weather Design](https://ios.uplabs.com/posts/weather-design) by [Zhao Legs](https://dribbble.com/ZhaoLegs) and [Black and White Weather](https://ios.uplabs.com/posts/black-white-weather) by [Emil Widlund](https://dribbble.com/emilwidlund).

###I downloaded the project, what now?
1. Go to the file directory and do a ```pod install```. You must have Cocoapods installed on your system. For more information on Cocoapods, visit [here](https://cocoapods.org/).
2. Next, go to "Constants.swift" under the "Utils" folder. Hop on to line 16 and insert your OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get one [here](https://openweathermap.org/price).
3. Build and Run the project!

###Requirements
1. Swift 3.0
2. Xcode 8.0+
3. Cocoapods 1.2.0 (Beta), should work with the stable release as well, although not tested.
